# React UI Challenge - Requirements

## Project Objective

Build a clean, functional, and well-structured React UI using Tailwind CSS. The goal is to evaluate your ability to structure components, handle data fetching and interactivity, and write clear and modular code.

## Overview

Using the JSONPlaceholder API, build a simple React application that displays a list of posts from the following endpoint:

```
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

### Post Data Structure

Each post includes the following fields:
- `userId` (number)
- `id` (number) 
- `title` (string)
- `body` (string)

## Core Functionality

Your application should:

1. **Fetch and display** the list of posts
2. **Show each post** in a list format (see mocks below)
3. **Allow the user to click** on a post to reveal a detailed view
4. **Include basic loading and error states** - display appropriate messages during data fetching

## Technical Requirements

### Framework & Libraries
- âœ… **React** with functional components
- âœ… **React Hooks** (useState, useEffect)
- âœ… **Tailwind CSS** for styling (no other styling libraries should be used)

### Code Structure & Quality
- âœ… Create **at least one custom hook** (e.g., for fetching data)
- âœ… Structure code using **clearly separated components**
- âœ… Include **inline comments** where necessary to explain decisions or non-obvious logic
- âœ… Keep **project structure clean and organized**

### User Experience
- âœ… Display **appropriate messages** during loading and error states
- âœ… **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes

## Stretch Goals (Optional)

If time allows, you may optionally add:

- ðŸŽ¯ **Search functionality** - A search input that filters the posts by title or body content
- ðŸŽ¯ **User filter** - A dropdown filter to show posts by a selected userId

> **Note**: The stretch goal is not required but will be considered a plus if implemented cleanly.

## Submission Instructions

### Deliverables
1. **ZIP file** of your completed project directory
2. **Screen recording** (5 minutes or less) walking through:
   - The UI and how to interact with it
   - An overview of the code structure and key decisions

### Timeline
- **Completion time**: You are expected to complete and return the assignment within 24 hours of receiving it
